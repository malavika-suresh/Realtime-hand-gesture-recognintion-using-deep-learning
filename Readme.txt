# ✋ Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning

This project implements real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam feed. A **LeNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained to classify **9 distinct hand gestures**. The application overlays the predicted gesture and its probability on the video stream in real-time.

## 🧠 Model Overview

A classic **LeNet architecture** (defined in `lenet.py`) is used for gesture classification. It has been adapted for recognizing hand gestures efficiently.

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python



▶️ Running Real-Time Gesture Recognition
Make sure your webcam is connected, then run:
    
    python3 main.py

🧪 Training the Model
- To train the CNN from scratch:
    python3 train_network.py
- The trained model will be saved as mask.model.

📷 Testing the Model
- To test the model using sample images in the images/ folder:

    python3 test_network.py

- Ensure that the folder contains valid gesture images.

🛠️ Troubleshooting

    Ensure correct paths for dataset, images, and model files.
    
    Use clear, well-lit hand gestures for better recognition.
    
    For low accuracy:
    
    Increase the dataset size
    
    Improve image quality
    
    Tune network hyperparameters or retrain
